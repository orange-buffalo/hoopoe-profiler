*hoopoe* is an open-source, forever free, no-ads java profiler.
It's main goal is to help java professionals to investigate and easily identify the bottlenecks in
performance of their applications. The main focus is on user-friendly presentation of
profiled results, providing developers with pleasurable profiling experience.

We want to make hoopoe-profiler as convenient as possible. Thus we value all the feedback and improvements proposals,
as well as constructive critics and bug reports. Community is the force to shape the hoopoe.
