== Contributing to hoopoe-profiler
We are currently in alpha-version phase and have not yet developed and established code-style,
pull requests and other policies.

The general advice is to contact us if you have any idea before implementing it.
We can discuss and decide about the best way to integrate your contribution.

Another way is just to file an issue, be it a bug, improvement or feature request.

As soon as code is stabilized we will provide more detailed guidelines
for contributions to hoopoe-profiler.
