== Integration Testing

We have developed a small framework around https://www.testcontainers.org/[Test Containers] which:

* allows to use any number of https://www.testcontainers.org/usage/generic_containers.html[Generic Containers]
(we do not support docker files and docker compose for now);
* provides API to deploy your plugin / extension into application running in Docker container;
* provides API to interact with a container while profiler is active and to retrieve profiled result.

=== Basics

[source,java]
----
    private static GenericContainer javaAppContainer = new GenericContainer("..."); <1>

    private static GenericContainer dbContainer = new GenericContainer("..."); <1>

    @ClassRule <2>
    public static HoopoeIntegrationTest integrationTest = new HoopoeIntegrationTest()
            .withHoopoeContainer(javaAppContainer) <3>
            .withContainer(dbContainer);

    @Test
    public void verifyMe() {
        HoopoeProfiledResult profiledResult = integrationTest.executeProfiled(() -> {   <4>
            ...
        });

        assertThat("Framework should return not-null result any time",
                profiledResult, notNullValue()); <5>
    }
----
<1> Define any number of Test Containers.
<2> Create a class rule of type `HoopoeIntegrationTest`.
<3> Provide container where profiler should be enabled to `withHoopoeContainer` method.
See below for more information.
<4> Execute any code you want to profile within your app in container, wrapped into `executeProfiled` call
(for instance, call an HTTP endpoint in your app which triggers code to be profiled).
<5> `HoopoeProfiledResult` will be returned with whatever was recorded during execution of code in `executeProfiled`.

=== Container with profiler

Container provided for `withHoopoeContainer` method will be enriched with Hoopoe Profiler agent:

* `HoopoeIntegrationTest` rule will create agent jar and make it available inside container.
* New environment variable with the path to agent jar will be added to the container: `HOOPOE_AGENT`.
* It is a responsibility of a developer to enable agent for his app in container (i.e. add
`-javaagent:$HOOPOE_AGENT` to the arguments of `java` process).
